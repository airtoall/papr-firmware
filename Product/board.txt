# Product build property overrides
#
# This file is used by Visual Micro when compiling the project.
#
# We need this file because our MCU clock is 8 MHz and we therefore need to override 
# the default clock speed of 16 MHz.
#
# We use 8MHz clock speed for this project so we can avoid having a crystal. Instead, we use the MCU's built-in
# oscillator. This saves some money, and frees up 2 pins. The MCU runs slower (8 MHz instead of 16) but we don't
# need the extra speed. The 8MHz oscillator frequency is probably less precise than a crystal would provide,
# but the most time-critical task we do is coulomb counting and it's OK to be off by a few percent.
