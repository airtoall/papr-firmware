 * This file acts as the glue between the Arduino runtime and the main program in Main.cpp.

 * We do it this way so that we can run the Main program either in the actual product,
 * or from a unit test environment. (Note: as of July 2021 there is no unit test setup,
 * but in theory we can/should do it sometime).
