This project is the firmware that runs the Air-To-All PAPR version 1.

This is an Arduino-compatible app, that mostly uses Arduino APIs to access the hardware.

This project can be built with either the Arduino IDE, or Visual Studio with the [Visual Micro](https://www.visualmicro.com) extension.

This project use the Arduino libraries "ButtonDebounce 1.0.1" and "FanController 1.0.6". To ensure repeatable builds,
these Libraries have been saved to our visual studio project. (FYI I did this using Visual Studio > Extensions > vMicro > Add Library, with the Clone For Solution option).
